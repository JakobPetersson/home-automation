# home-automation

Configuration and setup for my Home Automation project.

I currently have this running on a Raspberry PI 4 (8GB).

## Setup

Checkout this repository and run `setup.sh` to install docker and configure usb access rights.

```sh
./setup.sh
```

## dev.sh

`dev.sh` is a simple utility to control the Docker Compose setup.

## git-sync.sh

`git-sync.sh` is a small script for syncing code updates from git.
